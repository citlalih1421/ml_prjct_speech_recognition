# Hello! 

This a project for CSE 4683 (Machine Learning & Soft Commputing) at Mississippi State.

This project focuses on building a speech recognition system to help students better understand teachers with different accents by providing accurate transcripts and clear summaries of lectures. The system will use two main components: speech transcription and summarization. These will be implemented using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformer models to compare their performance on open-source datasets. The end goal is to create a tool where users can upload audio and receive both a transcription and a summary in one simple system.

*** 

The following are things to keep in mind for this project..... 

## Python virtual environment
    1. download virtualenv
        `pip install virtualenv`

    2. create virtual environment
        `python -m venv myenv`
    
    3. Activate virtualenv
        `source myenv/bin/activate`
    

    4. Deactivating virtualenv
        `deactivate`
